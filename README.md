# Glyph Printer
Glyph Printer is a c++ project that aims to enable the user to save any glyph as an image from any provided font file. You can save glyphs at any scale or edit it's existing vertices. What you can not do in his project (yet) is enabling the user to output new font file after vertices have been edited. If you wish to design Logos or expose glyphs in a certain font file, this app is for you.
